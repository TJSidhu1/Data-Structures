/*ðŸ’¼ Scenario: Hospital Emergency Room
Each patient is represented as a struct with:

name (string)

severity (int) â€” higher number = more severe

arrivalTime (int) â€” smaller number = earlier arrival

ðŸŽ¯ Priority Rules:
Higher severity patients come first.

If severity is equal, earlier arrival comes first.
Write a code to show which patients are processed according to the rules above.*/
